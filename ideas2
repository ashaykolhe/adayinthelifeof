Dad when are you going to quit smoking? asked the child. Soon sweetheart he said. The man in mid 30s closed his laptop after a busy day's work and looked at the child, his eyes glistening with endearment. Sometimes your old man needs to relax. he said. He'd always been upfront with Rudhvi. Maybe if you'll see enough trauma in your life, you'll understand why people smoke and drink, he said apprehensively thinking back at his old life. He took the child on his lap and pondered how her life is going to change soon.

The phone rang and his train of thought derailed. Hello! a heavy voice said, am I speaking to ashay? yes! who's this? The name's irrelevant. i want to let you know that your child is going to be kidnanped today. They know where you live. From one father to another, stay safe. The phone cut. The man's anxious heart dropped. ---He was expecting the call but it was a day early.--- Wondering if it was one of his old acquaintance, he hugged the child tightly imagining what he'd do if he lost her. His brain now racing to think who the man was. His voice sounded familiar but he couldnrt quite recognise it.

He called his ex-wife and asked if he can drop by, his voice sounded tense. He put on his coat and left with the child. The night was cold. The child looked at her dad wondering why he was tense. You look worried daddy, said the child. Everything's fine sweetheart, you'll be staying with your mommy tonight. She looked happy. They had divorced an year ago and he had won the child's custody. Her drunk and erratic behaviour had finally caught up on him.

Hope your stay at rehab was comfortable, the man said. Arriving at his ex-wife's house, he put the child to bed. It was anyting but comfortable. But I found Dave there so all in all, thanks to you for sending me there. Dave was her boyfriend, the head of the city's AA chapter. He was a standup guy and somehow he liked him. Where is Dave? he asked. He is upstairs sleeping, she said.

He wanted to leave at that point but he heard the child cry and went upstairs to checkup on her. But she wasnt in her bed. he called her name but no reply. Dave's room door was ajar. He looked inside but Dave wasn't in his bed either.
His heart sank. He had a habit of going into downward spiral when something negative happened. He went downstairs and couldnt find his ex-wife. The whole house was empty. He pondered if the caller was Dave and they had plotted her kidnapping. His thoughts racing, he ran out. He could'nt believe this was happening. Their car was in the garage. They could'nt have gone far he thought. He ran on the road in blistering cold without his coat wishing he hadn't left his house. There was no sign of them.

He called up his friend and asked if he could come over. It's urgent! he said as a matter of factly. His voice  Still coming to his senses, he drove his car and ran over every red light. His head had begun to throb. His migraines had started 3 years ago around the time Rudhvi was born. At the beginning his head would fill up with static noises and then gradually, he started to hear a faint voice intermittently. You have schizophrenia, his shrink had said.

He reached her home around midnight. It was full moon. He rang the bell. A young lady in her early 20s opened the door. She hugged him, kissed his cheeks and asked him to come inside. Long time no see, she said. I missed you. His mind still hadn't come to senses and he ignored her. Do you have aspirin? he asked. Top shelf in the bathroom! she said. He pushed her aside and went to the bathroom, looked for aspirin. He swallowed a few hoping it'd take the edge off his throbbing head.
