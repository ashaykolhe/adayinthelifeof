Dad when are you going to quit smoking? asked the child. Soon sweetheart he said. The man in mid 30s closed his laptop after a busy day's work and looked at the child, his eyes glistening with endearment. Sometimes your old man needs to relax. Maybe if you'll see enough trauma in your life, you'll understand why people smoke and drink, he said apprehensively thinking back at his old life. He took the child on his lap and pondered how her life is going to change soon.

The phone rang and his train of thought derailed. Hello! a heavy voice said, am I speaking to ashay? yes! who's this? The name's irrelevant. i want to let you know that your child is going to be kidnanped today. From one father to another, stay safe. The phone cut. The man's anxious heart dropped. ---He was expecting the call but it was a day early.--- Wondering if it was one of his old acquaintance, he hugged the child tightly imagining what he'd do if he lost the child. His brain now racing to think who the man was. His voice sounded familiar but he couldnrt quite recognise it.

He called his ex-wife and asked if he can drop by, his voice sounded tense. He put on his coat and left with the child. The night was cold. The child looked at her dad wondering why he was tense. You look worried daddy, said the child. Everything's fine sweetheart, you'll be staying with your mommy tonight. She looked happy. They had divorced an year ago and he had won the child's custody. Her drunk and erratic behaviour had finally caught up on him.

Hope your stay at rehab was confortable, the man said. Arriving at his ex-wife's house, he put the child to bed.

the expirement goes wrong and the child gets sent in the past. it was the only way to save the child.
The caller was him only, he could save either his ex-wife or his child. save the child his exwife said He had to put the wheels into motion so that child could be saved. if he didn't call, his child would die. the child had the mark and he was marked for death by the underworld.
