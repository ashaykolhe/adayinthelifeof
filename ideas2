Dad when are you going to quit smoking? asked the child. Soon sweetheart he said. The man in mid 30s closed his laptop after a busy day's work and looked at the child, his eyes glistening with endearment. Sometimes your old man needs to relax. he said. He'd always been upfront with Rudhvi. Maybe if you'll see enough trauma in your life, you'll understand why people smoke and drink, he said apprehensively thinking back at his old life. He took the child on his lap and pondered how her life is going to change soon.

The phone rang and his train of thought derailed. Hello! a heavy voice said, am I speaking to ashay? yes! who's this? The name's irrelevant. i want to let you know that your child is going to be kidnanped today. They know where you live. From one father to another, stay safe. The phone cut. The man's anxious heart dropped. ---He was expecting the call but it was a day early.--- Wondering if it was one of his old acquaintance, he hugged the child tightly imagining what he'd do if he lost her. His brain now racing to think who the man was. His voice sounded familiar but he couldnrt quite recognise it.

He called his ex-wife and asked if he could bring Rudhvi over, his voice sounded tense. He put on his coat and left with the child. The night was cold. The child looked at her dad wondering why he was tense. You look worried daddy, said the child. Everything's fine sweetheart, you'll be staying with your mommy tonight. She looked happy. They had divorced an year ago and he had won the child's custody. Her drunk and erratic behaviour had finally caught up on him.

Hope your stay at rehab was comfortable, the man said. Arriving at his ex-wife's house, he put the child to bed. It was anyting but comfortable. But I found Dave there so all in all, thanks to you for sending me there. Dave was her boyfriend, the head of the city's AA chapter. He was a standup guy and somehow he liked him. Where is Dave? he asked. He is upstairs sleeping, she said.

He wanted to leave at that point but he heard the child cry and went upstairs to checkup on her. But she wasnt in her bed. he called her name but no reply. Dave's room door was ajar. He looked inside but Dave wasn't in his bed either. His heart sank. He had a habit of going into downward spiral when something negative happened. He went downstairs and couldnt find his ex-wife. The whole house was empty. He pondered if the caller was Dave and they had plotted her kidnapping. His thoughts racing, he ran out. He could'nt believe this was happening. Their car was in the garage. They could'nt have gone far he thought. He ran on the road in blistering cold without his coat wishing he hadn't left his house. There was no sign of them.

He called up his friend and asked if he could come over. It's urgent! he said as a matter of factly. His voice quivering, still coming to his senses, he drove his car and ran over every red light. His head had begun to throb. His migraines had started 3 years ago around the time Rudhvi was born. At the beginning his head would fill up with static noises and then gradually, he started to hear a faint voice intermittently. You have schizophrenia, his shrink had said.

He reached her home around midnight. It was full moon. He rang the bell. A young lady in her early 20s opened the door. She hugged him, kissed his cheeks and asked him to come inside. Long time no see, she said smiling. I missed you. His mind still hadn't come to senses and he ignored her. Do you have aspirin? he asked. Top shelf in the bathroom! she said. He pushed her aside and went to the bathroom, looked for aspirin and swallowed a few hoping it'd take the edge off his throbbing head. What's wrong?, she sensed his anguish, now looking worried.

Rudhvi's been kidnapped! he said, his thoughts still racing to find his next option at hand. She looked dazed. He explained to her, quivering. I think we need to call the police, he said as the situation started to dawn on him. He took a pack of smokes out of his pocket and lit one. He offered her one but she declined. Cigarettes would usually calm him down but this time they didnt. He asked her to get her coat but she stopped him. She asked him to come upstairs. This is hardly the time for that, he said. She ignored him. She guided him to a room that he'd always found locked. I normally would not let anyone in this room, she said. I haven't been completely honest with you. I am a psychic. What the hell are you taking about, we are pressed for time. We need to leave. He said, now starting to lose patience. He was dumbfounded wondering how this was any helpful at all. He'd known her since childhood. They were next door neighbours and practically spent all the time together. She had moved out after her father was KIA in Iraq war. They had lost all contact but years later she was able to find him somehow.

The room was dimly lit with faint smell of sandalwood. The room was filled with candles and an oddly shaped drawing in the middle of the room which he realised was a pentagram. There is something you should know about Rudhvi. She is a telepath. I first noticed this when you complained of hearing static noises in your head. I was able to trace the voices to her. That's when I realised she wasnt a normal child. You don't have schizophrenia, Ashay. Dazed, He just looked at her as if she was blabbering nonsense. Trust me, I know what I am doing, she said. Tonight's a full moon. I will be able to channel my energy through you to find her.

She guided her to the pentagram. They both stood close together her breathing shallow and heart fluttering. As soon as he stood there, He was transported to his old house. He was standing in the porch waving goodbye to his closest friend. Tanvi crying through the car's window, she muttered something and closed her eyes ready to bid goodbye to the love of her life. He felt a surge of energy pass through him and was transported to another place. This time a dark moonlit alley. He realised it to be the fort on the outskirts of the city. On the edge of the alley stood a dark hooded figure and a woman whispering to each other. He tried to get closer without them noticing him. Their voices were faint and undecipherable. The moonlight shone on her face and he realised it to be Tanvi.



There's a car following her, she noticed. He hadn't realised it before.

a hooded figure and tanvi talking to her. She didn't realize rudhvi had a unknowingly cast a protective spell on her dad. tanvi compromised and wanted to find tanvi for the dark hooded figure.
