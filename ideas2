Dad when are you going to quit smoking? asked the child. Soon sweetheart he said. The man in mid 30s closed his laptop after a busy day's work and looked at the child, his eyes glistening with endearment. Sometimes your old man needs to relax. Maybe if you'll see enough trauma in your life, you'll understand why people smoke and drink, he said apprehensively thinking back at his old life. He took the child on his lap and pondered how her life is going to change soon.

The phone rang and his train of thought derailed. Hello! a heavy voice said, am I speaking to ashay? yes! who's this? The name doesnt matter. i want to let you know that your child is going to be kidnanped today. From one father to another, stay safe. The phone cut. The man's anxious heart dropped. Wondering if it was one of his old acquaintance, he hugged the child tightly imagining what he'd do if he lost the child. His brain now racing to think who the man was. His voice sounded familiar but he couldnrt quite recognise it. He called his ex-wife and asked if he can drop by.



The device broke and his ex-wife was stuck in the past
