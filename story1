"Dear Ashwini, I wish I could start off with a good news but I regret to inform you that I have been laid off from my job.

Unexpected travels with Rudhvi though amazing put my job in peril.

Wish you were alive to see how amazing our daughter is.", he wrote in his daily journal.

He got up from his study table to check up on Rudhvi. She was sound asleep. His head was throbbing from all the commotion downstairs.

He had moved to a small town in a modest 1 bedroom apartment with his daughter since his wife passed away while giving birth to Rudhvi.

She turned 1 this year.
