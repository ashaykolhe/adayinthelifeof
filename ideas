future

what promise to tanvi?
who was the mystery man?
How did he come to know about the place.


the only way to kill her was once the enchantment was done. So it was necessary for Rudhvi to be kidnapped.
The wife must be killed as she was the reason for apocalypse.


her psychic powers are at their peak during full moon and at the lowest at new moon.

the child is telepathic and could actually communicate with her father. The voice in his head was his daughter's. His friend was a psychic and she taught him how to connect with the child.

The caller was him only, he could save either his ex-wife or his child. save the child his exwife said He had to put the wheels into motion so that child could be saved. if he didn't call, his child would die. the child had the mark and he was marked for death by the underworld due to her powers. she can read minds.

They kidnapped her to save her. He was compromised and could not be trusted.
