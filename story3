A day of indulgence

"New day, new beginnings!", Azad said stretching himself after a good night's sleep. "Oye asshole, wakeup!". His best friend was lying next to him, half asleep. "Will you take a look at this gorgeous view". Hordes of tanks and artillery were entering the border city of Lahore. The Indians were advancing rapidly. The war looked grim. Jai woke up to the sound of a distant explosion. "Azad, we can't live here for long, the sepoy are probably looking out for you.", Jai said. The fearless son of a General, Azad was the youngest of the two. Still in early teens, Azad wanted to join the Pakistani Army. His elder brother was killed in the Kargil war. Jai could see vengeance in his eyes.
