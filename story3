A day of indulgence

"New day, new beginnings!", Azad said stretching himself after a good night's sleep. "Oye asshole, wakeup!". His best friend was lying next to him, half asleep. "Will you take a look at this gorgeous view". Hordes of tanks and artillery were entering the border city of Lahore. The Indians were advancing rapidly. The war looked grim. Jai woke up to the sound of a distant explosion. "Azad, we can't live here for long, the sepoy are probably looking out for you". The fearless son of a General, Azad was the youngest of the two sons. Still in early teens, Azad wanted to join the Pakistani Army. His elder brother was KIA in the Kargil war. Jai could see vengeance in his eyes.

They packed their bags and left their broken shelter that's been their home since war broke out a week ago. Now out of food and water, they started scrounging. Visiting house by house, eating whatever leftover food they could find. Life in the city was in shambles for the elite and the poor alike. The bourgeois was the most affected. With limited ration, increasing demand and no supply, people started fighting for every last morsel. "War is hell!", Jai said as they searched an empty house. "War is not hell, it's tragic. So many helpless innocent people caught in the crossfire. Hell would not be filled up with such people.", Azad said. "War shows the true colours of humanity, it showcases it at its worse. You think dictatorship is bad because of a bad apple, imagine democracy where all the parties are bought and paid for and now the real rulers are the military industrial complex. At least the dictatorship can end with the death of the ruler, but democracy goes on!". Jai could see his eyes glisten with hope and revenge.

A noise at the door froze both of them, Azad took out his brother's pistol that he'd been carrying since the war broke out. With only a single bullet left, he knew he had to make it count. A quiet whisper between the two was enough to shake up the house. They saw a silhouette of a girl running toward the door. They dashed toward her, caught her by the neck, put the gun to her temple and awaited. She closed her eyes and started chanting Bhagavad Gita. Surprised, Jai asked Azad to put the gun down. "Where are you from...uhh", Azad said, "Saba", she said, "Saba, where are you from?", he repeated. She was quiet. "Where are your parents?", "Dead", she replied. Now feeling sorry, Jai asked her to face him. He looked her straight in the eyes, "Are you a spy?". "No, of course not.". "We can't trust her", Azad said. Jai wasn't convinced.
