"I need a new life!", he blurted out as he gulped down a couple of tablets. "My brain just doesn't work that fast anymore Doc. It's fried! Could be the tablets, could be Alzheimer's! God knows." Snehal listened patiently as she jotted down notes. "I feel trapped and I wanna break out of this cage but I am afraid I'll wreck havoc.", he said. "What kinda havoc do you think you'll wreck, Aj?", Snehal asked. "The worse kind. The kind where I don't differentiate between the innocent and the guilty. The one where everyone but me is a criminal. I have bloodlust Doc. Why did you become a psychiatrist Doc?", he said. "Our time is up Aj. Our next appointment is next week.", she said. "Don't leave just now Doc. I feel so lonely here. When are they gonna let me out? It's killing me here. I am gonna extinguish here if I stay here any longer." She listened patiently before standing up. Aj was in a straight jacket tied to the chair. "Doc, doc! please, I'll behave. Please ask them to let me out.", he pleaded.

"He's not yet ready, Dad.", she said as the hospital warden pondered quietly. "Will my son ever get better?", he said. She looked at him wondering the same question.

"It's on a need to know basis.", the police chief had said.
